//In World Recipes for 1.22

Reduce the amount of recipe types
Fix Ender Dragon rendering

1.6.0
- Added FTB Ultimine support for Block Interaction Recipes

1.5.10
Working?

1.5.9
Empty output_block_state now set the block to air, if using air in the output_block_state just remove instead

1.5.8
Changed BlockState input in Block Interaction Recipe to BlockTarget, this retains old functionality but also allows for tags to be used,
 use "target_block_state": "#minecraft:leaves" instead of other "target_block_state"

1.5.7
Change JEI left and right click to translations

1.5.6
Block Interaction Recipe now shows fluid output blocks in JEI

1.5.5
Update JEI Integration to only show the blockstates that are actually used in the recipe

1.5.4
Block Interaction Recipe now show correct item output count in jei
Empty / air output_block_state now show chance results in JEI, Empty show that block is uneffected and air shows that the block is removed
Block Interaction recipes that use a certain block state the recipe now only looks for those block states, block with additional
    block states with additional properties will check the default state for that property
Basically if you want a lit furnace to be the target block if needed to also face the default direction of the furnace block now, if the
    facing direction is the same as the default state it will work it will assume that this state is not needed to be checked.
This is not a perfect solution but it is better than the previous one where it would not work at all if the block had additional properties

1.5.3
Drop Item In Fluid now takes a list of SizedIngredient instead of a single SizedIngredient
json format changed to this

  "dropped_items": [
    {
        "count": 1,
        "item": "minecraft:emerald"

    },
    {
        "count": 1,
        "item": "minecraft:diamond"
    }
  ],

1.5.2
Added optional field for block interaction called "ignore_block_state" defaults to false
When true the block interaction recipe will not check for block state properties just the block

1.5.1
Chance results are now optional in block interaction recipe
Disabled chat debug

1.5.0
Added Block Interaction Recipe this is a more advanced recipe type that allows for custom block states,
    this will replace some of the other recipe types in the future

  "block_to_convert": "minecraft:emerald_block",
  "converted_block": "minecraft:obsidian",
  "pop_block": false,
  "requires_sunlight": false,
  "duration": 100
}
block_to_convert is required (block placed to be converted)
converted_block is required (block to be placed after conversion)
duration is required and is the amount of time in ticks it takes to convert the block
pop_block is optional and defaults to false
requires_sunlight is optional and defaults to false
requires_moonlight is if the block requires sunlight to convert
dimension is optional and defaults to "none", this is the dimension the block will be converted in
